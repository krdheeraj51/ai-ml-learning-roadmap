## LangGraph Concepts

LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-step, and multi-agent workflows for language models. Here are the key concepts:

1. **Graph-Based Workflows**
	- Workflows are modeled as directed graphs, where nodes represent actions and edges represent transitions.

2. **Nodes**
	- Each node performs a specific task, such as calling a language model, tool, or agent.

3. **Edges and Transitions**
	- Edges define how data flows between nodes. Transitions can be conditional, allowing for branching logic.

4. **State Management**
	- LangGraph maintains a state object throughout the workflow, enabling memory and context passing.

5. **Loops and Branching**
	- The graph structure allows for loops (repeating steps) and branching (choosing different paths).

6. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
	- Supports workflows involving multiple agents, each with its own role and responsibilities.

7. **Integration with LangChain**
	- Designed to work seamlessly with LangChain, leveraging its tools, chains, and agents.

8. **Extensibility**
	- Users can define custom nodes, transitions, and state logic for specific use cases.
